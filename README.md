# Timer-Irrigazione-intelligente
An Arduino Nano project:  Smart Irrigation system with potentiometer, DHT, and relay control for 
efficient watering a plant, realized without using libraries to directly accessing microcontroller registers.

The present project aims to develop a smart irrigation system for a potted plant that can detect 
and monitor soil moisture, as well as measure ambient temperature and humidity to control the irrigation valve when necessary.
The main goal is to automate the plant watering process, ensuring proper soil moisture levels in the pot 
based on desired humidity thresholds, and adapting the irrigation duration according to environmental conditions and user-defined corrective parameters.
A button allows users to set these parameters or trigger an immediate control cycle.
Due to the limitation of using specific libraries, the project requires our adaptability and problem-solving skills 
to work at a lower level by directly accessing microcontroller registers or developing custom functions and libraries.
